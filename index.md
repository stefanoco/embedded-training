### Modules composition

Coaching for Embedded Products Development is composed of a series of loosly coupled modules.                                                                                                                      
Effective improvement of own process can be obtained by selecting the relevant module(s) based
on past and present experience and expected outcome.

The perfect audience is the entire product development team inside a company, including
both software and hardware design engineers and related management.

### Module format

Teaching and coaching for each module out of the list is usually delivered in the form of:

- two half days of teaching with the aid of slides and examples (four hours each)
- one half day of coaching at the initial stage of adoption of a process or tool (four hours)
- eight hours of remote assistance

### Initial interview

We suggest that an additional four hours interview module is spent before defining what modules
to base the improvement on, in order to achieve:

- assessment of the team capabilities
- full involvement of the audience
- better understanding of the expected outcome
